    - [ ] Allow players to select cards from their hand.
    - [ ] Add buttons for actions like "Play," "Pass," or "End Turn."

    Scoreboard and Level Display:
    - [ ] Show the current scores, tricks won, and player/team levels.

    Game Messages:
    - [ ] Display messages for turn indicators, invalid moves, and round results.

4. Gameplay Flow
    Start New Game:
    - [ ] Initialize players, teams, and the deck.
    - [ ] Deal cards to players and determine the initial trump suit.

    Rounds and Turns:
    - [ ] Implement the turn order for 4 players.
    - [ ] Manage the flow of each trick (playing cards, validating moves, determining trick winner).

    Round End:
    - [ ] Calculate the winning team of the round.
    - [ ] Update scores and levels based on the number of tricks won.

    Game End:
    - [ ] Set conditions for when the game ends (e.g., a team reaching a certain level or score).

5. Multiplayer Functionality (Optional)
    - [ ] Add local multiplayer support for 4 players on one machine.

    Implement online multiplayer:
    - [ ] Use Python's socket library to create a server    -client model.
    - [ ] Enable real    -time gameplay for remote players.

6. Audio and Visual Effects
    - [ ] Add sound effects for:
    - [ ] Dealing cards.
    - [ ] Playing cards.
    - [ ] Winning/losing tricks.

    Implement animations:
    - [ ] Smooth transitions for cards played.
    - [ ] Highlight the current trick's winning card.

7. Game State Management
    Save/Load Game:
    - [ ] Implement functionality to save the game state and load it later.

    Pause/Resume Game:
    - [ ] Add a pause menu with options to resume or quit.

8. Testing and Debugging
    Test individual components:
    - [ ] Card generation and dealing.
    - [ ] Valid move checks.
    - [ ] Trick    -winning logic.

    Debug UI elements:
    - [ ] Ensure smooth interactions and transitions.
    - [ ] Verify correct card displays and animations.

    Playtest:
    - [ ] Run the game multiple times to ensure rules and progression work as intended.

9. Documentation
    - [ ] Write clear inline comments in the code.

    Create a README with:
    - [ ] Game rules for Sheng Ji.
    - [ ] Instructions to run the program.
    - [ ] Features and screenshots.

10. Polish and Optimization
    Add a main menu:
